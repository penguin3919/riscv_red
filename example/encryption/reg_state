# Kite register state
#   1. Each line of state file defines "register name = data value".
#   2. Register state defines 32 integer registers from x0 to x31,
#      and 32 double-precision floating-point registers from f0 to f31.
#   3. x0 register is hard-wired to zero. Any non-zero values written to x0
#      register is discarded.

# 64-bit integer registers
